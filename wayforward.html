      <h2>Way Forward</h2>
<p>To work on the I, We and It-goals I’ve described, I want to take consistent steps throughout this project. </p>
<p>When it comes to interrupting, I plan to pause and breathe before I speak. If I feel the urge to jump in, I’ll write down my thought instead. I want to listen more fully and wait until someone has finished before responding. I also want to experience what it feels like when I don’t speak up and let a thought or idea go. </p>
<p>To stop taking on too many tasks, I will check in with myself before I act. I want to notice when I start taking control and give others the space to contribute first, in their own way. I’ll also remind myself that I don’t always have to fix or carry everything. </p>
<p>To improve my formal English, I’ll practise using clearer and more structured language. I’ll pay attention to how I speak in meetings and how I write in project documents, and I’ll actively use new words and expressions as I learn them. </p>
<p>Starting this Monday, I will share my personal goals with the team. On this website, I’ve added a simple tracker where my teammates can give me feedback during the project on the first two goals. I’ll also keep a short daily journal to reflect on how things went. This will help me stay aware, make small changes as I go, and track my progress over time. </p>
