      <h2> Goals </h2>
<p>As mentioned in the previous sections, I have three short-term goals. I want to become a better listener, take on less responsibility in group work and get more confident using formal academic English. These goals help me focus not just on what I contribute to this project but also on how I work with others and develop along the way.</p>
<p>My long-term goal is to finish my studies with strong results and build a portfolio of meaningful work. I hope to graduate summa cum laude, but more importantly I want to feel proud of what I’ve made and what I’ve learned. I’m also considering a PhD. In the future, I would like to work in an urban design team in a city like London, Amsterdam or New York on projects that are creative, collaborative and socially relevant. </p>
