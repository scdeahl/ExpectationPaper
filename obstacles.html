      <h2>Obstacles</h2>
<p>Going back to university brings a few challenges I didn’t fully expect. One of them is working in a team where almost everyone is from a younger generation. At Advier, I’m usually not the oldest person in the room. There, I work alongside seniors and have guidance from more experienced colleagues. Here, I’m often the oldest — and in many cases, the only one with professional work experience. That changes the group dynamic.</p>
<p>Another challenge is language. I’ve been working almost entirely in Dutch for the past few years. Although I speak English fluently, I’m less experienced in using formal academic English. This affects how confident I feel when speaking in class or writing for university. </p>
<p>Lastly, this is my first time at a research university. I did my bachelor’s at the Hogeschool van Amsterdam, a university of applied sciences. That gave me a solid foundation, but the academic expectations here are different and sometimes unfamiliar. </p>
<p>All of these things stand in the way of me being the best student I can be. They influence how I work, how I communicate, and how much I feel I belong in this environment. </p>
