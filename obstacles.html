      <h2>Obstacles</h2>
<p>On my journey to the top of the mountain — toward the project outcome (It) and my long-term goals — I face both personal and academic challenges.</p>
<p>Firstly, there are personal obstacles that affect me and my team. I tend to interrupt when I get excited, which can disrupt conversations. I sometimes take over tasks or try to control outcomes because I struggle to fully trust others’ pace, quality, or methods. Perfectionism and a strong drive to achieve can also get in the way of genuine collaboration. These habits, though well-intentioned, can make it harder for others to contribute and for the group to find its own rhythm.</p>    </div>
<p>Secondly, there are obstacles in my academic journey. One of them is my formal English. During my modelling career, I became fluent in English, but not in an academic or professional context. At Advier, we mainly communicate in Dutch, so I haven’t had much real-world practice with formal English. This sometimes makes me feel less confident when presenting or speaking in class, even when I know what I want to say.</p>
