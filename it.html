      <h2>It</h2>
<p>The outcome I’m working toward is a project I can be proud of. I want it to reflect smart, creative, and professional work — something that goes beyond a student assignment and shows what I’m capable of. Ideally, it becomes part of a larger project or continues in some form after the course. I also hope it’s something I can include in my portfolio when I return to the work field.</p>
<p>A high grade matters to me too. I currently average an 8.5 and hope to graduate summa cum laude. But even more than that, I want to submit something that feels complete. Something I genuinely believe in.</p>
<p>This project is also a chance for me to work on my formal academic English. I want to get better at how I write and speak in academic settings. I can express myself well in English, but I still catch myself searching for the right words or struggling to find the right tone.</p>
