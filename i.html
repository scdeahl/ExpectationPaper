      <h2>I </h2>
   <p>During this project, I would like to become a better listener. I want to learn to manage my enthusiasm, avoid interrupting others, and give people the space to speak fully before I respond. I can get carried away, especially when I’m excited about a topic. These interruptions can disrupt conversations and affect collaboration. The article Interruptions and Silences in Conversations: A Turn-Taking Analysis supports my reflections. It shows how interruptions, even when well-intentioned, can disturb the flow of conversation or unintentionally exclude others (Lestary et al., 2018). It also reminds me that silence has meaning — it creates space for thought and emotional signals, which I sometimes rush past in my eagerness to contribute.</p>
   <p>This is important to me because I believe this habit stands in the way of truly expressing myself and listening to others. I’m at a stage in my life and career where I expect more of myself. I’ve been working on this issue already, but I would like to use this project as the final push to overcome it.</p>
<p>In the Way Forward section, I propose ideas to support this change.</p>
