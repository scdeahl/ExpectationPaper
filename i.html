      <h2>I – Personal Reflection</h2>
      <p>My personal development goal during this project is to become a better listener. I want to learn to manage my enthusiasm, avoid interrupting others, and give people the space to speak fully before I respond. I have a tendency to get carried away, especially when I am excited about a topic. I recognise that this behaviour — which I jokingly refer to as my "labrador tendencies" — can disrupt conversations and affect collaboration.</p>
      <p>This goal is important to me because I believe my current habit stands in the way of having truly good discussions. I’m at a stage in my life and career where I expect more of myself. I’ve been working on this issue already, but I would like to use this project as the final push to overcome it.</p>
      <p>To support this change, I rely on personal strengths: I regularly reflect through journaling, I ask for feedback, and I am not afraid to face uncomfortable truths. At the same time, I know my enthusiasm and strong focus can make me forget the people and energy around me.</p>
      <p>The article “Interruptions and Silences in Conversations: A Turn-Taking Analysis” supports my reflections. It shows how interruptions, even when well-intentioned, can disturb the flow of conversation or unintentionally exclude others. It also reminds me that silence has meaning — it creates space for thought and emotional signals, which I sometimes rush past in my eagerness to contribute (Lestary et al., 2017).</p>
