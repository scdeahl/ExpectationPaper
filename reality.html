      <h2> Reality</h2>
<p>I studied Engineering Design and Innovation, with a focus on product design, and got my bachelor’s degree in 2015. After that, I worked full-time as a fashion model for five years. During COVID-19, I felt the urge to return to design. I started working at Advier, a design and consultancy agency in Delft, where I focused on mobility and urban development.</p>
  <p>That job sparked my curiosity again. I wanted to learn more and go deeper. At 36, I went to university for the first time. It was a big step, but it felt right. I feel motivated and I’m doing well in the course. At the same time, I know I can be too eager — I take on too much and sometimes put a lot of pressure on myself.</p>
