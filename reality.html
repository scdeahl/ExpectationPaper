      <h2> Reality</h2>
<p>After graduating with my bachelor's degree in 2015, I spent five years working full-time as a fashion model. During the COVID-19 period, I reconnected with my design background and began working at a design and consultancy agency in Delft called Advier, where I focused on mobility and urban development. This experience renewed my interest in gaining more in-depth knowledge and motivated me to transition into the academic world. I am doing well in the course and feel highly motivated. At the same time, I am aware that my eagerness sometimes leads me to overcommit and place too much pressure on myself.</p>    </div>
