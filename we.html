      <h2>We </h2>
      <p>In this project, I want to be someone who connects ideas and people. My aim is to help ensure everyone’s strengths are used and that each voice is heard. I want to model professionalism and be a reliable and thoughtful teammate.</p>
      <p>To do that, I need honesty from my team. I’ve asked them to tell me when I do too much or take over tasks that weren’t mine to begin with. I know I have a tendency to control outcomes because I sometimes find it hard to trust others’ pace, quality, or approach. But I don’t want that anymore. I want to let go, make room for mistakes — theirs and mine — and build something together.</p>
      <p>The challenge of overachieving in group work is well-documented in research on team power dynamics. Strong individual drive can lead to imbalances in collaboration, where one member dominates or controls the outcome, often unintentionally (Courtright et al., 2017). This confirms for me that I need to actively step back and support shared ownership within the group.</p>
