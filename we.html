      <h2>We</h2>
<p>In this project, I want to help shape a team where ideas and responsibilities are shared. That means being aware of how I show up and when I might be taking up too much space. I know I have a habit of jumping in, especially when I feel unsure about the pace or quality of the work. It’s usually meant to help, but I’ve realised that doing too much can leave less room for others to contribute.</p>
<p>This tendency is also shaped by context. Because I’m older and have more work experience, people in group settings often look to me for direction or expect me to take the lead. I understand why. But if I’m not careful, that dynamic can create an imbalance (Greer, van Bunderen, & Yu, 2017). Power in teams doesn’t always come from intention. Sometimes it just happens. And when one person consistently takes charge, it can stop others from stepping in or developing their own voice.</p>
<p>I’ll return to this in the Way Forward section, where I share what I plan to do differently.</p>
